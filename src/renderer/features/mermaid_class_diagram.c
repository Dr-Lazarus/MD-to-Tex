/* 
 * Parses the provided Mermaid class diagram code into a structured format
 * that includes class nodes and their relationships. This structured format
 * is then used to generate a corresponding LaTeX representation.
 * Parameters:
 * - mermaidCode: A string containing the Mermaid code for a class diagram.
 * - classNodes: An array to be populated with parsed class nodes.
 * - classNodeCount: A pointer to an integer to hold the count of class nodes parsed.
 * - relationships: An array to be populated with the relationships between class nodes.
 * - relationshipCount: A pointer to an integer to hold the count of relationships parsed.

 * - classNodeCount: The number of class nodes in the classNodes array.
 * - relationships: An array of relationships between the class nodes.
 * - relationshipCount: The number of relationships in the relationships array.
